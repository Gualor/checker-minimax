# checker-minimax
AI for Checkers using Minimax algorithm.

In this project the popular board game of Checkers has been designed and implemented by using the Pygame framework. The game follows the rules of International Draughts, which is played on a 10x10 checkerboard. The Artifial Intelligence (AI) implemented in the opponent uses the classic Minimax algorithm with a custom evaluation function in which the game board is evaluated with a score. The evaluation function is the core of the algorithm and the better is designed, the more intelligent the AI will be, and consequently harder to beat.

# Aim of the project:
The aim of the project was not to create the perfect AI, but rather to investigate how powerful this algorithm can be in a popular 2 players game with an average knowledge of its strategies and tacticts. The minimax algorithm at the current stage has been proposed in its raw form without Alpha-Beta pruning. Regarding the evaluation function, all the criteria and metrics implemented follow my judgement and understanding of the game, no ispiration from other projects was taken in order to be more challenging for myself.
